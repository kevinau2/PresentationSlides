Sharding
	• MongoDB allows distribution of its contained data set across several replicas which collectively form a replica set
		○ This means basically there are several daemon instances/background processes ("mongod") which all manage the same set of data
			§ Each set of data is ideally on a separate machine but should at least refer to a physically separate location on disk 
		○ Benefits:
		○ Permits fault tolerance in the event of failure in one of the hosting servers
		○ Greater throughput as disk accesses can be handled by different machines in the cluster, lower latency
		○ Recovery upon failure
	• Can elect to shard the database
		○ Divides the database into separate partitions and places each partition onto (ideally) a separate cluster of machines
		○ Different from full replication in that each cluster only holds a portion of the data
